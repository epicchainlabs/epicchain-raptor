## Developing or Contributing  

Contributions are welcomed! To set up a development environment:  

1. Install the development dependencies:  
   ```bash  
   pip install -e .[dev]  
   ```  

2. Follow these contribution guidelines:  

   - **Code Formatting**:  
     This project uses [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) for consistent code formatting. Run `make black` to format your code or integrate it into your editor ([instructions here](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/integrations/editors.html)).  

   - **Docstrings**:  
     Ensure all public functions and classes are documented with clear and concise docstrings.  

   - **Type Annotations**:  
     All code must include proper type annotations. Test your typing with:  
     ```bash  
     make type  
     ```  
     If typing is impractical for specific cases, provide a detailed explanation for exclusion.  

   - **Testing**:  
     Write tests to cover any new or modified code. Validate your tests with:  
     ```bash  
     make test  
     ```  
     Measure test coverage using:  
     ```bash  
     make coverage  
     ```
